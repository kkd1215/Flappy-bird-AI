# Flappy-bird-with NEAT
This was a fun project for me.
Here we creat an AI which plays the game Flappy Bird.

# Description
We firstly create the game with Pygame and then use the NEAT module to make the AI.

  ### About Pygame ###
  pygame is a Python wrapper for the SDL library, which stands for Simple DirectMedia Layer. SDL provides cross-platform access to your       systemâ€™s underlying multimedia hardware components, such as sound, video, mouse, keyboard, and joystick. pygame started life as a           replacement for the stalled PySDL project. The cross-platform nature of both SDL and pygame means you can write games and rich 
  multimedia. Python programs for every platform that supports them!

  ### About NEAT ###

  [NEAT](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is a method developed by Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen for evolving arbitrary   neuralnetworks.

  This project is a Python implementation of NEAT with Pygame dependency.
